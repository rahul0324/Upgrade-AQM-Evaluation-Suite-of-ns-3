# Upgrade-AQM-Evaluation-Suite-of-ns-3
AQM Evaluation Suite is an automated framework to evaluate the AQM algorithms implemented in ns-3. Although it works with the latest ns-3-dev, there is a lot of redundant code that can be now removed from the suite to make it lightweight and optimized. The aim of this project is to optimize the suite and publish it on ns-3 app store
